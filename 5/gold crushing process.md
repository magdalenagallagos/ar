A slurry of ground ore,water and a weak cyanide solution is fed into large steel leach tanks where the gold and silver are dissolved.Following this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver.This process removes 93% of the gold and 70% of the silver.
